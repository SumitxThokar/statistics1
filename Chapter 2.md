# Chapter 2: Measures of Central Tendency

## 2.1) Arithmetic Mean

### A. For individual series
$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum X}{n}$$
 ### B. For Discrete series
$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum fX}{n}$$
 ### C. For Continuous series
$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum fm}{n}$$

## 2.2) Median
### A. For individual series
$$M_d =(\frac{ N+1}{2} )item$$

 ### B. For Discrete series

$$M_d = L + \left(\frac{\frac{N+1}{2}-F}{cf}\right)h$$


 ### C. For Continuous series
$$M_d = L + \left(\frac{\frac{N}{2}-F}{cf}\right)h$$



## 2.3) Mode
### A. For Individual & Discrete data
Data with the highest frequency.

 ### B. For Continuous series
$$\text{Mode} = L + \frac{(f_1 - f_{0})}{(f_1 - f_{0})+(f_1 - f_{2})} \times C$$

where $\text{Mode}$ is the mode value, $L$ is the lower boundary of the modal class, $f_1$ is the frequency of the modal class, $f_{0}$ is the frequency of the class before the modal class, $f_2$ is the frequency of the class after the modal class, and $C$ is the class interval.
