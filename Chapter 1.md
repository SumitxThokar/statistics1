# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1) Intro to Statistics

Statistics is  the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.
  

## 1.2) Data

Data are measurements or observations that are collected as a source of information. The types of data are:
<br/>
**A. Primary Data**: Data collected by analyst or investigator himself.<br/>
**B. Secondary Data**: Data collected by analyst or investigator but used by other people.

### Methods to collect data:
**A. Personal Interview**
<br/>
**B. Indirect Interview**
<br/>
**C. Mailed Questionnaire**
<br/>
**D. Telephone Interview**
<br/>
**E. Information through Correspondants**


## 1.3) Measurement Scale
Measurement scale refers to a system of assigning numerical values to variables or data points in a research study. It helps to classify and categorize the data in a meaningful way for analysis.

There are 4 measurement scales.

**A. Nominal Scale**: It is the simplest measurement scale and categorizes data into distinct, non-overlapping categories, such as gender or race. Nominal scales do not have any numerical value assigned to them, and they only serve to differentiate one category from another.

**B. Ordinal Scale**:  This scale assigns numerical values to data in a specific order, such as ranking or rating scales. The numerical values represent the order, but not the amount of difference between the categories.

**C. Interval Scale**:  An interval scale assigns numerical values to data that have a meaningful order and a consistent distance between values. An example of an interval scale is the Celsius temperature scale.

**D. Ratio Scale**: The ratio scale is the most comprehensive measurement scale, as it includes all the features of the other scales. It has a meaningful order, a consistent distance between values, and an absolute zero point, such as weight or height. The values of a ratio scale can be compared using multiplication or division.
